## Recap 
1. OOP
2. inheritance  - aggregation
3. encapsulation ? Data hiding 
4. polymorphism - many forms 
Run time polymorphism(overriding ) vs Compiler time polymorphism (overloading)



## abstraction 

summary of something 
not explaining everything 

Run car  -- how it works internally 
use mobile phone  - 
use internet 


two ways 
1. abstract classes [0- 100]  , abstract and non abstract methods 
2. interfaces  [Java 7 ] - 100 % of abstraction 




Rules 
1. if there is 1 or more abstract method in class, class needs to be abstract 
2. if class if abstract , it may or may not have abstract methods 
3. abstract class can have both methods, abstract and conrete[non abstract]
4. Abstract classes can not be instantiated / can not create object of


## final [interview]
1. variable - constant 
2. method - can not be overriden 
3. class - can not be inherited 


## Interface

class Scanner, System

Interface - type 
class blueprint ---  Interface 


def : its contract , whoever is going to implement it, has to adhere that contract
