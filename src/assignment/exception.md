## Custom Exceptions Problem

Problem: Develop a program to simulate a voting system for an election. 
The program should include the following components:

Create a Voter class with a method void setAge(int age) to set the age of 
the voter. If the age provided is less than 18, throw a custom exception 
InvalidAgeException with the message "Age must be 18 or above to vote."

Implement a Main class to test the voting system. Create an instance of the 
Voter class and attempt to set the age of the voter. 
Handle the InvalidAgeException by printing the error message associated 
with the exception.

If the age set is valid (i.e., 18 or above), simulate the process
of casting a vote by printing "Vote cast successfully!"

Write the Java code to implement the voting system and test it using
the Main class.

Feel free to expand upon this problem by adding additional features or 
functionality to the voting system.
