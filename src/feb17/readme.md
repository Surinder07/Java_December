2. Interfaces - 


// Java 7
interface Test{
   public static final variables 
   public abstract methods 

}

// Java 8 


3. final

# Nested class
classes inside another class

1. Inner class
2. static inner class 
3. Annoymous Inner class 




===============
## Packages ?
collection of classes, subclass or interfaces , subpackages 
but of similar type

1. easy to maintain 
2. naming conflicts

# types 
in built packages  -- which is already in java
-- > util , lang, io, awt,


user -defined  -- which is created by user
--> src, assignment
-- naming convention --- all lower case 
 not even camel casing 


## protected 
access modifier

## Exception Handling 

Error - we can not control 

shut down the power 
1TB- 



## Exception - which we can control 

Exception something which breaks the normal flow of execution of program.


## Exception Handling 
we try to handle exceptions so that normal flow of execution of program 
can be maintained. 


1.checked exception - compile time exception  

2.unchecked exception - Run time exception 




                  Throwable 
            |
        Exception 
      |
RuntimeException
|
NullPointerException


final vs finally vs finalize



1. throw - when you want to throw an exception explicitly [your own exception ]
2. throws - when you throw an exception for someone else to handle it
